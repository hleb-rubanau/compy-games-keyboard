-- Input lifecycle and event model.
--
-- The game registers compy.input.hooks.* instead of love.*
-- handlers, and its reserved chords and the Alt class are
-- compy.input.shortcuts entries, which run ahead of the hooks.
--
-- OS key repeat is filtered by the isrepeat flag the hooks get
-- as their third argument. setTextInput(true) below is for
-- running as a plain LOVE program: the IDE makes the same call
-- at boot, under its Android settings, so inside it the line is
-- redundant and undoing it on exit is a no-op. Global key
-- repeat is left ON -- the repeats are filtered rather than
-- suppressed, and stopping them would change what scenes see.
--
-- keypressed and textinput have NO guaranteed order between
-- them, and nothing here may depend on which arrives first.
-- So acceptance never asks whether the producing key is held:
-- at the first character of a press that answer differs by
-- build. A character is CLAIMED instead, one per press -- has a
-- character for this key been taken since the key was last down
-- -- and the claim is released by asking the KEYBOARD once a
-- frame (inputTick), never by an event. No grace window, no
-- frame clock.
--
-- Modifier state is asked of the keyboard through Key, which
-- folds each l/r pair the way a combo string does; the key-cap
-- renderer needs it from draw, where there is no event to
-- consult.

-- A chord's trigger is claimed when the chord is taken: Alt+H,
-- then letting go of Alt, leaves H repeating, and those
-- characters are not a typed answer. Claiming twice is free.
local function claimChord(k)
  spendGlyph(k)
end

-- The app's reserved keys, none of which reaches a scene.
--
-- stop_here says the combo is taken. ignore_repeat goes inside
-- it wherever there is an action, since stop_here alone re-runs
-- that action on every OS repeat: a held ctrl+alt+up would ramp
-- the notch every frame. A claim goes OUTSIDE it -- an action
-- fires once per press, a claim stands while the key is down.
--
-- A combo is its modifier set EXACTLY, so a gesture that also
-- tolerates Shift is bound twice, to the same handler value.
-- "alt+*" and "alt+shift+*" are the swallowing classes: every
-- Alt chord without Ctrl is taken, never reaching a scene as a
-- typed target, and their only job is the claim. An exact
-- binding wins over a class, so alt+p / alt+shift+p pause and
-- claim for themselves.
-- Ctrl+Alt+H is a different modifier set, so a different class.
-- It re-arms the active scene's hint through the onHint
-- descriptor entry, the way ctrl+alt+up reaches onNotch. Being
-- a shortcut it is taken in EVERY scene, including the ones
-- that judge key targets.
